# Mini project for Cruncho - By MULLER Thibault

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS

## Configuration

- In public/index.html, put your Google Places API key where it belongs

## Launch the application

- Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```
npm run start
```

## Usage

- Once the user accepted the app to use the location, the 10 nearest restaurants are computed and displayed on the map.
  By clicking on those locations, you can view their name and how far away you are directly on the map, and have more details in the overview at the bottom.
- You can also select a restaurant in the list on the right, it will open the details, and it should be highlighted on the map.

### Notes

- Still eager to add new features soon.
